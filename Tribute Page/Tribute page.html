<h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Lindemann was born on 4 January 1963 in Leipzig (then in East Germany),
     the son of Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) journalist Brigitte Hildegard "Gitta" Lindemann and poet Werner Lindemann.
     His parents first met at a conference in Bitterfeld in 1959. He grew up in Wendisch-Rambow alongside his younger sister, Saskia.
     At age 11, Lindemann went to a sports school at the Empor Rostock Sport Club, and attended a boarding school from 1977 to 1980.
     His parents lived separately for career reasons after 1975, and divorced when Lindemann was still young.
     He lived with his father for a short time, but the relationship was unhealthy; in the book Mike Oldfield im Schaukelstuhl, 
     is father wrote about his own problems with alcoholism and the difficulties of being a father to a teenage Lindemann.
     In 1978, Lindemann participated in the European Junior Swimming Championships in Florence, finishing 11th in the 1500 m freestyle and 7th in the 400 m freestyle,
     swimming a time of 4'17"58; he was shortlisted to go to the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, but left the sport due to an injury. 
     According to Lindemann, "I never liked the sport school actually, it was very intense. But as a child you don't object."
     He later worked as an apprentice carpenter, a gallery technician, a peat cutter, and a basket weaver.His mother dedicated a letter titled Mein Sohn, der Frontmann von Rammstein ("My son, the frontman of Rammstein") to Lindemann in 2009.
     The first album he owned was Deep Purple's Stormbringer.</p>

<h2>Career</h2>
<p>Lindemann started to play drums for Schwerin-based experimental rock band First Arsch in 1986, who released an album titled Saddle Up in 1992,
     and played one song ("Lied von der unruhevollen Jugend") with a punk band called Feeling B, which was the former band of Rammstein members Paul Landers, Christoph Schneider and Christian "Flake" Lorenz in 1989.
     During his time in Feeling B, he played the drums in the band. In the 1990s, Lindemann began to write lyrics. In 1994, the band entered and won a contest in Berlin that allowed them to record a four track demo professionally.
     When questioned as to why Rammstein was named after the Ramstein air show disaster,he said he viewed images of the incident on television, and that he and the bandmates wanted to make a musical memorial.
    Lindemann then moved to Berlin. During Rammstein's early years, because of his use of over-the-top pyrotechnics, Lindemann has burned his ears, hair and arms.
     Bandmate Christoph Schneider commented, "Till gets burned all the time, but he likes the pain." An incident in September 1996 caused a section of the band's set to burn, 
     and as a result, Lindemann got his certification in pyrotechnics so the band could perform with pyrotechnics more safely than it had previously.</p>
